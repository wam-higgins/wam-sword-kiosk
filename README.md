2. Download new version into a zip file
3. Unzip the file -> new folder
4. Connect your computer to the iPad and upload files to the iPad under Kiosk Pro Plus
5. The app should be updated; if the app did not update, make sure the folder name and file path name (in Kiosk Pro Plus settings) match

*videos must be named accordingly and be in mp4 format in order to be read
